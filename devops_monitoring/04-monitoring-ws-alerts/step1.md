## Your Prometheus and Grafana environment is starting
Give it some time to load all the images and start up. It is happening as you read these lines automatically.

We have added a **dummy smtp server** to your environment.

Please see `workshop-prometheus-grafana/docker-compose.yml`{{open}} and check the mailhog service.

You can find mailhog UI on port 8025:

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8025-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

In this exercise we will set up alerts and observe them on the dummy mailhog service as they are triggered how Grafana will send emails.

### Generate some metrics

Send tens of requests to Nginx on localhost:8080 (200, 404...) and fill PostgreSQL database:

### 2xx
```
./infinite-200-req.sh
```{{execute}}

### 4xx
```
./infinite-404-req.sh
```{{execute}}

### Create a new Nginx dashboards

Display 2 graphs:

- number of 2xx http requests per second

- number of 4xx http requests per second

Tips: you should use `sum by(<label>) (<metric>)` and `irate(<metric>)` (cf PromQL doc).

  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Solution</summary>

  Query graph 1: `sum by (status) (irate(nginx_http_requests_total{status=~"2.."}[1m]))`

  Legend graph 1: `Status: {{ status }}`

  Query graph 2: `sum by (status) (irate(nginx_http_requests_total{status=~"4.."}[1m]))`

  Legend graph 2: `Status: {{ status }}`

## Save your Dasboard
Don't forget to name and save your dashboard. Alerts are sensitive to saving a dashboard

## Set up E-mail alert channel in Grafana
Use the left menu for alerts / channels
Add a new Channel with a desired name and type E-mail.

## Create alert rule for one of the above panels

For example you could use: `when avg() of query(A,5m,now) is below 0.5`
