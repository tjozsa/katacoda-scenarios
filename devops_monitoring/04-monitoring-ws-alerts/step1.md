## Your Prometheus and Grafana environment is starting
Give it some time to load all the images and start up. It is happening as you read these lines automatically.

We have added a **dummy smtp server** to your environment.

Please see `workshop-prometheus-grafana/docker-compose.yml`{{open}} and check the mailhog service.

You can find mailhog UI on port 8025:

https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8025-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

In this exercise we will set up alerts and observe them on the dummy mailhog service as they are triggered how Grafana will send emails.

## Set up an alert
Use Grafana UI to set up some alerts and use the HTTP/SQL scripts to trigger them.

### Generate some metrics

Send tens of requests to Nginx on localhost:8080 (200, 404...) and fill PostgreSQL database:

### 2xx
```
./infinite-200-req.sh
```{{execute}}

### 4xx
```
./infinite-404-req.sh
```{{execute}}

### inserts data into pg
```sh
./infinite-pg-insert.sh
```{{execute}}

### Import PG dashboards to Grafana

Go on [https://grafana.com/dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards) and find a dashboard for PostgreSQL, compatible with Prometheus and wrouesnel/postgres_exporter.

  Those exporters looks nice: [https://grafana.com/dashboards/6742](https://grafana.com/dashboards/6742), [https://grafana.com/dashboards/6995](https://grafana.com/dashboards/6995).

### Create Nginx dashboards

Display 2 graphs:

- number of 2xx http requests per second

- number of 4xx http requests per second

Tips: you should use `sum by(<label>) (<metric>)` and `irate(<metric>)` (cf PromQL doc).

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Solution</summary>

  Query graph 1: `sum by (status) (irate(nginx_http_requests_total{status=~"2.."}[1m]))`

  Legend graph 1: `Status: {{ status }}`

  Query graph 2: `sum by (status) (irate(nginx_http_requests_total{status=~"4.."}[1m]))`

  Legend graph 2: `Status: {{ status }}`

## Export some business metrics

Let's display in real time:

- number of users
- number of posts per user

### Export data

Grab custom metrics with `postgresql-exporter` by adding queries to `custom-queries.yml`:

- Metric `user_count` of type `counter` => `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;`
- Metric `post_per_user_count` of type `gauge` with user_id and email in labels => `SELECT u.id, u.email, COUNT(*) FROM posts p JOIN users u ON u.id = p.user_id GROUP BY u.id;`

Example and syntax [here](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter/blob/master/queries.yaml).

[http://localhost:9187/metrics](http://localhost:9187/metrics) should output:

```
[...]

# HELP user_count_count Number of users
# TYPE user_count_count counter
user_count_count 2

# HELP post_per_user_count_count Number of posts per user
# TYPE post_per_user_count_count gauge
post_per_user_count_count{email="foobar@gmail.com",id="e1c10ca1-60c8-405c-a9f3-3ff41456ca9f"} 1
post_per_user_count_count{email="samuel@grep.to",id="fde08ee6-5fb9-4c4f-9b40-dc2ad69bb855"} 2

[...]
```

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Solution</summary>

  Append to `custom-queries.yml`:

```yaml
user:
  query: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
  metrics:
    - count:
        usage: "COUNTER"
        description: "Number of users"

post_per_user:
  query: "SELECT u.id, u.email, COUNT(*) FROM posts p JOIN users u ON u.id = p.user_id GROUP BY u.id;"
  metrics:
    - count:
        usage: "GAUGE"
        description: "Number of posts per user"
    - id:
        usage: "LABEL"
        description: "User id"
    - email:
        usage: "LABEL"
        description: "User email"

```

</details>

### Graph time!

With `user_count{}` and `post_per_user_count{id,email}` metrics, build following graphs:

Simple graph of users signup (`rate(<metric>)`):

![assets/grafana-user-signups.png](assets/grafana-user-signups.png)

Heatmap of signups (`increase(<metric>)`):

```
docker-compose exec grafana grafana-cli plugins install petrslavotinek-carpetplot-panel
docker-compose restart grafana
```

![](imgs/grafana-heatmap-signups.png)

Table of top 10 users per post count (`topk()`, `sum by(<label>) (<metric>)`):

![](imgs/grafana-table-top-contributors.png)

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Solution</summary>

  Query 1: `rate(user_count{}[1m])`

  Query 2: `increase(user_count{}[$__interval]) > 0`

  Query 3: `topk(10, sum by (id, email) (post_per_user_count{}) > 0)`

</details>

### Expose /metrics from a micro-service

You can play with this sample in NodeJS: [microservice-demo/README.md](microservice-demo/README.md).

Don't forget to update Prometheus configuration in `prometheus.yml` !

## More ideas to exercise

- Monitor a Redis server, a RabbitMQ cluster, Mysql...
- Increase data retention (15d by default).
- Setup alerting with AlertManager and basic rules
- Setup Prometheus service discovery (consul, etc, dns...) to import configuration automatically
- Limits: multitenancy - partitionning/sharding - scaling - cron tasks
