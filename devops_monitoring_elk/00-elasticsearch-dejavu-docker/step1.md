First you need to start Elasticsearch stack. We have already downloaded you a git repository. All you need to do is start it from the terminal:

Check `docker-compose.yml`{{open}}

`docker-compose up -d`{{execute}}

This can take a while.

Once the docker-compose environment started you will be able to access the Dejavu interface here:
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-1358-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Or you can use the taps we prepared in the editor.
