First you need to start ELK stack. We have already downloaded you a git repository. All you need to do is start it from the terminal:
`docker-compose up`{{execute}}

This can take a while.

Once the docker-compose environment started you will be able to access the Kibana interface here:
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-5601-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

Or you can use the taps we prepared in the editor.
