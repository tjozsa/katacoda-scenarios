### Welcome

### Let's take a look at the goal
This is one of the out of the box dashboards that you will see once you deploy the sample applications and the Beats (Elastic's lightweight shippers for logs, metrics, etc.) in this Katacoda environment and connect the Beats to the Elasticsearch Service in Elastic Cloud.  This is the Docker metrics dashboard that ships with Metricbeat.  It shows an overview of the CPU and Memory use of every container, allows you to drill in to a specific container, and the containers per node.  Looking at the dashboard is much easier than running the equivalent kubectl logs, events, top, describe, etc. commands.
